// TODO: Give some form of credit to ninja as being an intellectual
// predecessor. I am modeling certain parts of the library based on the test
// runner present in that build tool and they deserve some credit even if the
// adaption is not one to one.

// Ninja uses the Apache License so it should be fine to use the concepts which
// may count as a derivative work since the code is based off of their code.
